When adding a new album, there is the option of adding a youtube link.  If the youtube link is provided and valid, the album display will create an iframe viewing box.  If the youtube link is not valid, then the album will display a vinyl image in place of the iframe with a unique color.

Add the album to your favorites collection on creation, or toggle favorites on the display.

The default view displays all albums added to the collection.  Switch between viewing the entire collection and only your favorited albums by clicking the buttons on the navigation bar.
